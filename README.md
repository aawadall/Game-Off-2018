# Game Off 2018
A Seed Repository to participate in the [Game Off 2018](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2018)

This game is named __Monster Nursery__ since it is about breeding monsters to acheive tasks. It is, at heart, a realtime strategy game, with lots of mini-games attached to it.

We have passed Game Story phane, and are entering the development and asset preparation stages. 

This game is written in C#, Unity, and is a 2D console game, with some chances of porting it to a web interface.
